She applies the bronze shade on Irina's lid and then blends it into the crease. Next, she smudges Avon's Glimmer Stick Eyeliner in Blackest Black along the lash line to further define the eye. Anderson then coats Irina's lashes with Avon's Big and Daring Mascara to add volume without clumping.

In the next demonstration, Anderson shows how to play up the eyes instead of the lips. She uses the next deeper shade from the eyeshadow quad to smoke out the eye, using a tissue underneath to prevent fallout. She also defines the lash line with more eyeliner.

He begins by explaining that they offer a weekly program at the Green Library where students and employees can have their bikes repaired for free. Brant then proceeds to show the viewers the steps involved in fixing a flat tire. He starts by undoing the brakes in the back to make it easier to remove the tire. He mentions that some bikes have derailleur guards that need to be unscrewed before accessing the nut. Using a 15mm side, he removes the nut and then shows how to remove the tire using a tire lever or fingers. He states that not all tires are as easy to remove but most are. Brant then shows the tube that he will be using, explaining that it is the appropriate size for the tire. Before putting it on, he pumps up the tube slightly so that it takes shape. He demonstrates how to insert the valve in the hole and push the tire into the rim. He mentions that sometimes a tire lever may be needed for this step, but not in this particular case. Brant then pumps up the tire to a pressure of 40, which he says is suitable for a typical mountain bike like the one shown. He proceeds to put the whole tire back onto the bicycle and tightens it correctly, ensuring that the tire is centered. The last step is to reapply the brakes, and the repair is complete. Brant concludes by mentioning that they offer this repair service every Wednesday at the library from 11 to 2 and are also looking for volunteers.
